## Genealogy Tree Construction Using Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) and Levenshtein Distance

*Final Assignment for CS110: Problem Solving with Data Structures and Algorithms*

This project involves constructing local and global genealogy trees based on genetic sequences. We use two primary metrics: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) for the local tree and Levenshtein Distance for the global tree. The goal is to analyze and compare these methods to understand their suitability for different scenarios and derive mutation probabilities.

## Introduction

This repository explores methods to construct genealogy trees from genetic sequences using computational metrics such as LCS and Levenshtein Distance. It discusses their implementation, complexity analysis, and empirical evaluations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, matplotlib (for plotting)
